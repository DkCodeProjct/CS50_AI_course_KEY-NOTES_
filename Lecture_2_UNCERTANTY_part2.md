# Join Probability 

   * Joint probability is the likelihood of multiple events all occurring.

   +  Let us consider the following example, concerning the probabilities of clouds in the morning and rain in the afternoon.:

            ----------------------------
                
                C = cloud
                0.4
                
                C = ¬cloud
                0.6
                
                R = rain
                0.1
                
                R = ¬rain
                0.9

            ----------------------------


    * Looking at these data, we can’t say whether clouds in the morning are related to the likelihood of rain in the afternoon. To be able to do so, we need to look at the joint probabilities of all the possible outcomes of the two variables. We can represent this in a table as follows.:
            
            
            ----------------------------
                                
                C = cloud
                R = rain
                0.08
                R = ¬rain
                0.32
                
                C = ¬cloud
                R = rain
                0.02
                R = ¬rain
                0.58 
            ----------------------------
